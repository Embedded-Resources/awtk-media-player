专辑：

[00:20.95]Share my life, take me for what I am

[00:30.47]Cause I’ll never change all my colours for you

[00:40.16]Take my love, I’ll never ask for too much

[00:49.09]Just all that you are and everything that you do

[02:42.91][00:58.78]I don’t really need to look very much further

[02:47.74][01:03.69]I don’t want to have to go where you don’t follow

[02:52.37][01:08.25]I won’t hold it back again, this passion inside

[02:56.62][01:12.40]Can’t run from myself

[02:59.05][01:15.18]There’s nowhere to hide

[03:03.02](Your love I’ll remember forever)

[03:39.61][03:09.02][01:19.98]Don’t make me close one more door

[03:46.85][03:13.73][01:24.92]I don’t wanna hurt anymore

[03:51.05][03:17.90][01:29.04]Stay in my arms if you dare

[03:56.01][03:22.98][01:34.29]Or must I imagine you there

[04:09.89][04:06.04][04:00.35][03:27.61][01:38.77]Don’t walk away from me…

[04:15.73][03:32.56][01:43.95]I have nothing, nothing, nothing

[04:21.27][01:49.16]If I don’t have you, you

[01:59.65]you ,you, you

[04:30.64]If I don’t have you

[02:05.71]You see through, right to the heart of me

[02:14.49]You break down my walls with the strength of you love

[02:24.11]I never knew love like I’ve known it with you

[02:32.69]Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

[04:36.33]Oh~~
